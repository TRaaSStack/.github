## TRaaS 👋

TRaaS (Technological Risk-defense as a Service) is a green, stable and intelligent technical risk prevention and control solution. TRAaaS pays attention to the stability risks that may arise during the entire R&D operation and maintenance process, and provides stability risk prevention and control solutions from the aspects of process system, cultural promotion, technical solutions, and platform systems, so as to realize active risk discovery and self-recovery capabilities, and help business high-quality growth.

TRAaaS is an immune system that combines the entire distributed architecture and technical risk capabilities. It combines high availability and financial security capabilities with AIOps to enable the system to achieve self-healing from failures. In addition, TRAaaS also has the following six characteristics:

* Unified change management and control, intelligent change risk defense;
* Standard SOP fault management based on chatops, refined emergency positioning assistance;
* Intelligent resource capacity scheduling to achieve the optimal balance between stability and cost;
* Real-time intelligent real-time verification of trillion-level capital certificates;
* Large-scale chaos engineering drives stable technology evolution and promotes technology risk culture;
* AIOps improves operation and maintenance efficiency under controllable risks;

## Projects
* [CeresDB](https://github.com/TRaaSStack/CeresDB)  It is a time series database product based on the OceanBase distributed storage engine base. It is used to manage and store time series data, providing high-performance reading and writing, low-cost storage, and rich multi-dimensional query and analysis capabilities.
